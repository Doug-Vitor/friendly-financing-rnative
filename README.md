# Friendly Financing

Record your profits, losses and bills and use Friendly Financing to summarize them. You can use the app as guest or sign in to our services. You will receive daily notifications about yours bills when its close to due date.

## Features
- CRUD of profits and losses;
- Summary dashboard of your records.

## What I've learned
- Expo router;
- Usage of SQLite and Drizzle ORM.

## Running locally
 - Node, Expo and Android Studio or XCode are required;
 - Run the app with the `npm run android` or `npm run ios` command.

## Notes and next steps (may never be taken)
The initial purpose off this app was to publish it to the main app stores, since it could be considered a utility app, but I'm currently too busy to do that. But keep in mind that the expected main functionalities are:
- [ ] Allow user to sign up/sign in and store their data in a real database;
- [ ] Read, update and delete actions for bills;
- [ ] Send push notifications when a bill is close to due date.
